## Bio

I am a full-stack developer who trained at Makers Academy and graduated in January 2018. I have done projects primarily in Javascript and Ruby using Node.js, React and Rails. I am naturally curious and love the idea of creating usable products. I am really into games (logic, boardgames, videogames) and coding has been the first time in my life that I feel like I can apply those skills in a professional context which is amazing! In my past life, I graduated with a MSc International Management from the Rotterdam School of Management in the Netherlands and have worked as an Investment Banking Analyst, Operations Manager at a start-up and as Growth Marketing Manager. I am currently looking for a full-stack developer role in London where I can keep perfecting my software crafting skills.

## Skills

#### Multi-Tasking

Throughout my career I've always had to assume multiple roles in the same company. This happened because I was either involved in a lot of extra activities (in a more corporate context) or simply due to business requirements (in a more start-up context). I thrive on having multiple different challenges at once and I highlight my experience at Uniplaces where at the same time I was leading the Sales, Account Management and Operations teams which had very different profiles, strategies and requirements.

#### Fast Learning

Even though I had no coding background I feel like I managed the workload of the Makers Academy course decently. That said, I do believe that I pick up things fast. A key example was in our practice projects where I had to learn how to learn how to use Node.js, ensure all code was tested and present a final product. At the end, I am quite proud of my achievements and you can see the final product in the Project sections by clicking on Data Visualization.

#### Communication Skills

Throughout university, a lot of emphasis was put on communication and presentation skills as those are becoming more and more important in today's world. I have had to present and communicate very different messages to very different stakeholders and have had experience in tailoring my approach to the different scenarios. In particular, at ResearchGate, I had to define, structure, present and communicate the lead generation strategy going forward to both the Sales, Lead Generation and Executive team which all were focusing on different aspects.
