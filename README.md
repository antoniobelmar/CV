I am a full-stack developer who trained at Makers Academy and graduated in January 2018. I have done projects primarily in Javascript and Ruby using frameworks like Node.js or Rails. I am naturally curious and love the idea of creating usable products. In my past life, I graduated with a MSc International Management from the Rotterdam School of Management in the Netherlands and have worked as an Investment Banking Analyst, Operations Manager at a start-up and as Growth Marketing Manager. I am currently looking for a full-stack developer role in London where I can keep perfecting my software crafting skills.

## Skills

#### Multi-Tasking

Throughout my career I've always had to assume multiple roles in the same company. This happened because I was either involved in a lot of extra activities (in a more corporate context) or simply due to business requirements (in a more start-up context). I thrive on having multiple different challenges at once and I highlight my experience at Uniplaces where at the same time I was leading the Sales, Account Management and Operations teams which had very different profiles, strategies and requirements.

#### Communication Skills

Throughout university, a lot of emphasis was put on communication and presentation skills as those are becoming more and more important in today's world. I have had to present and communicate very different messages to very different stakeholders and have had experience in tailoring my approach to the different scenarios. In particular, at ResearchGate, I had to define, structure, present and communicate the lead generation strategy going forward to both the Sales, Lead Generation and Executive team which all were focusing on different aspects.
